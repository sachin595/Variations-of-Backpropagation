# Variations-of-Backpropagation
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this project, we focus on the application of neural network models for the classification of Electrocardiogram (EKG) records into two categories: "Healthy" and "Myocardial Infarction" (MI). The dataset comprises 47 clinical features derived from EKG signals, recorded from individuals, with the goal of determining if a subject has suffered a MI or is in a healthy state.

The basic Backpropagation training algorithm, as well as Backpropagation with momentum, will be applied to the training of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer to classify vectors with features from Electrocardiogram (EKG) patterns.The network will consist of 47 input processing elements representing the EKG features and a single output processing element. The output should indicate the likelihood of MI, with +1 for "Healthy" and -1 for "MI."
