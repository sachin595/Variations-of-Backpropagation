# Variations-of-Backpropagation
In this project the basic Backpropagation training algorithm, as well as Backpropagation with momentum, will be applied to the training of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer to classify vectors with features from Electrocardiogram (EKG) records into “Healthy” or “MI (Myocardial Infarction)”.
